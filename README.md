# Python and Node Socket Communication

##Directions
1. Start pythonSocketServer.py using Python3
2. Start nodeTransmitter.js using Node
3. Send commands from nodeTransmitter to pythonSocketServer

This is pretty well detailed in [Python's Doc Page](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/sockets.html "Python Socket Documentation")

Definitely a lot farther that this could go.  There is an example of how they threw this together using a Python Class to make it more object oriented, which you might ultimately prefer.

There were some benchmarks taken on Python performance [here]( http://codeandlife.com/2012/07/03/benchmarking-raspberry-pi-gpio-speed/).  Depending on how big it grows, it may be a decision of simplicity to performance.
